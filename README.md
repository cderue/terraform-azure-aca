# Terraform No-Code Infrastructure Module for Azure Container Apps

The Terraform No-Code Infrastructure Module for Azure Container Apps enables developers and teams to deploy and manage containerized applications on Azure without writing complex Terraform code. This module provides a configuration-driven approach to provisioning scalable, secure, and event-driven container applications.

## Key features:
- No-code deployment – Use simple configuration files to deploy and manage containerized workloads without Terraform expertise.
- Automated scaling – Supports dynamic scaling based on HTTP traffic, events, or CPU/memory utilization.
- Integrated networking – Easily configure ingress, custom domains, and internal networking for microservices.
- Security & observability – Implements Azure-managed identity, role-based access control (RBAC), and monitoring via Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.
- CI/CD integration – Works seamlessly with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps for automated deployments.

## Use cases:
- Deploying microservices and APIs in a fully managed container environment.
- Running event-driven applications that scale dynamically.
- Simplifying DevOps workflows by automating infrastructure provisioning.
